\usage{
matos_login(UserName = NULL, Password = NULL)
}
\description{
This function prompts you for the username (email) and password associated with
your MATOS account. This is necessary so that you may interface with any
project-specific files. If you don't have a MATOS account
\href{https://matos.asascience.com/account/signup}{you can sign up for one here}.
Log in is completed using the \href{https://rstudio.github.io/rstudio-extensions/rstudioapi.html}{RStudio API};
this probably won't work if you're not using RStudio, so it will be changed in the future.
A pop up will appear asking for your username and password. If everything works
out, your credentials will be kept in the sessions' cookies. Your username/password
will not be saved -- this was done intentionally so that you don't accidentally
save credentials in a public script.
